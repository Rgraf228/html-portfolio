<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I started my programming journey in high school actually, not from classes I took in high school but from googling
  "How to learn to code" which of course brought me various free options to learn to code. But me being me and being new
  to the coding world- I stunk which meant that I promptly said I'm not doing this and dropped it instantly.</p>
<p>However, at the tender and ripe age of 28 I decided that I wasn't doing much with my life and went back to that very
  same question I had googled all those years ago... "How do I learn to code?" <strong>EXCEPT</strong> this time I was
  actually going to stick with it and I have!</p>

<p>I've learned to really enjoy coding, and really enjoy the problem solving aspect of it and boy oh boy in the very
  beginning was my code <strong>BAD</strong> but as time went on I learned a lot and now have set myself the goal of
  becoming a Software Engineer.</p>
